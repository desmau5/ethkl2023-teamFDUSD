## Team Vision
We envision a future where decentralised finance is defactor how modern societies will be living in.
Free from the control of the agency/institution that has nothing but pure greed in power and corruption.

## Problem Statement


## Why compliance is important?

Cryptocurrency was created to combat the challenges of the traditional financial system. 
However, crypto isn't perfect, and there have been numerous records of fraudulent transactions, crypto cybercrime, and illegal misuse of digital assets. 
In order for mass adoption to be possible, the community need to weed out the bad actors.
Cryptocurrency compliance is the first steps in building a safer crypto future for mass adoption.
Without gaining trust, there will be no trustless.
