## Problem Statement
**USD3.9 billion crypto fraud in year 2022. **
In crypto world, many people is getting scam/hack/rug-pull left right center. This is really bad for the industry. 
Currently for mass users, there is almost impossible to check if the wallet belong to a malicious identity. 
Or at least, the research part is tedious and complicated. What if there is a portal that can tell you right away if this is a trustable wallet address?


## Why compliance is important?
Cryptocurrency was created to combat the challenges of the traditional financial system. 
However, crypto isn't perfect, and there have been numerous records of fraudulent transactions, crypto cybercrime, and illegal misuse of digital assets. 
In order for mass adoption to be possible, the community need to weed out the bad actors.
Cryptocurrency compliance is the first steps in building a safer crypto future for mass adoption.
Without gaining trust, there will be no trustless.
